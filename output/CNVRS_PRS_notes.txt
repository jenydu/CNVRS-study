ACRONYM:
RS = risk score
cov = genetic PC covariates and phenotypic (neuropath/cognitive) covariates

What each column represent:

phenotype

risk_score

t: 
t stats of the risk score in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov'

p: 
p-val of the risk score in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov'

adj.r: 
adjusted R-squared value of the 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov' model

t_w_prs: 
t stats of the risk score in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov + PRS'

p_w_prs: 
p-val of the risk score in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov + PRS'

adj.r_prs: 
adjusted R-squared value of the 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov +PRS' model

anova_p: 
ANOVA 'Pr(>F)' p value of the F statistic

AIC: 
Akaike information criterion of 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov' (lower AIC = better fit of the data)

AIC_w_prs: 
Akaike information criterion of 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov + PRS'

prs_ad_t: 
t stats of PRS in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov + PRS'

prs_ad_p: 
p-val of PRS in 'phenotype ~ RS1 + RS2 + cov + PRS'
